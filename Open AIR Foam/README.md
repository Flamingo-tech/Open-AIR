# AIR Foam
 Is a simple foam block that can be inserted into the following ducoboxes:
 - DucoBox Silent Standard
 - DucoBox Silent Perilex
 - DucoBox Silent Connect
 - DucoBox Focus
 
 This will silence your Ducobox a bit. I tested with a calibrated Mini DSP microphone and captured the before and after installation.
 
 This is at maximum speed (before foam):
