# Open_Air
Open source system for home ventilation and control via Home Assistant. The goal of this project is to create an eco system of open source Home Assistant compatible devices that can be installed in a wide variaty of ventilation devices. 

The Open AIR system must be able to do the following:
 - Measure Humidity in an air duct.
 - Measure Co2 in an air duct.
 - Measure Temperature in an air duct.
 - Wifi enabled by default
 - Fully controllable by Home assistant
 - Open source

The long term goal is to creat a completely open source and 3D printed (orcourse recycled plastic) ventilation box.

#### Open AIR Mini:
The Open AIR Mini is an open source controller that works with the following ventilation boxes:
- DucoBox Silent Standard
- DucoBox Silent Perilex
- DucoBox Silent Connect
- DucoBox Focus (Warning: Original Duco Valves are not supported!)
- Orcon MVS-15RH
and more...\

#### Open AIR Valve:
The Open AIR Valve is a open source valve that works with the following ventilation boxes
- DucoBox Silent Standard
- DucoBox Silent Perilex
- DucoBox Silent Connect
- DucoBox Focus (Warning: Original Duco Valves are not supported!)
In the future an external housing will be made for the Open AIR Valves. This can then be installed next to any ventilation box.

# Backwards Compatibility

If this is the awnser to this is yes, you can use the sensor in the original Duco Silent ventilation box.
