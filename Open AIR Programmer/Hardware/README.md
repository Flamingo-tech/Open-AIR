# Open AIR Programmer

The Open AIR Programmer is an open-source programmer that is compatible with all Open AIR devices, including Open AIR Mini, Open AIR Valve, and Open AIR Sense.
Additionally, the programmer can be used to program the original Duco Ventilation boxes. To do this, you will need to download the Duco Network tool provided by Duco.

The Open AIR Programmer uses a CP2102 chip. To install the drivers for this chip, please click [Here](https://github.com/Flamingo-tech/Open-AIR/tree/main/Open%20AIR%20Programmer/Software) or : [Here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
The Open AIR Programmer uses a standard USB-C cable to connect to the device. For more information about the pinout of the connector, please check the schematic files.


### Status LEDs
The Open AIR Programmer has three status LEDs: one for active transmit, one for active receive, and a 5V power LED. During normal operation, the 5V LED should be on. When there is a transmit or receive, the TX or RX LED should blink.
